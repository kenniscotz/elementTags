                 A anchor tag can also be used in replacement of an img tag.
                 
                 

            </p>
            <h3>Some of the Anchor tag attributes</h3>
            <ul>
                <!-- List of attributes associated the anchor tag -->
                <li>download</li>
                <li>href</li>
                <li>target</li>
                <li>title</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <b>download</b>: his attribute instructs browsers to download a URL instead of navigating to it, 
                so the user will be prompted to save it as a local file. 
                If the attribute has a value, it is used as the pre-filled file name in the Save prompt (the user can still change the file name if they want). 
                There are no restrictions on allowed values, though / and \ are converted to underscores. Most file systems limit some punctuation in file names,
                 and browsers will adjust the suggested name accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>href</b>: The href Contains a URL or a URL fragment that the hyperlink points to. Aside URL, the href can be used initiate a call, which the "tel" opens the browser also the mailto, which opens the mail.

                
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>target</b>: _self: Load the URL into the same browsing context as the current one. This is the default behavior.
                _blank: Load the URL into a new browsing context. This is usually a tab, but users can configure browsers to use new windows instead.
                _parent: Load the URL into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.
                _top: Load the URL into the top-level browsing context (that is, the "highest" browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent).
                 If there is no parent, this behaves the same way as _self.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>title</b>: Contains a text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to. 
                Such information can typically, but not necessarily, be presented to the user as a tooltip.
